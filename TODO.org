* README How to download offline AWS documentation
:WHY:
I find their web documentation to be quite lacking in usability.
Also, makes it harder to link to from Org Mode, etc.

Luckily, all of their documentation is open-sourced, so I can just
clone all of their repos.

I think it is very important for me to have documentation that I am
comfortable browsing.  It drastically accelerates my learning both
when getting started and when referencing on down the road.
:END:
Currently, https://github.com/awsdocs has 183 repositories, so the
following command sequence will work to download all of them:

#+CAPTION: Clone all documentation repos (<= 200)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for page in 1 2
do
    wget -qO- "https://api.github.com/orgs/awsdocs/repos?per_page=100&page=$page" \
        | jq ".[].ssh_url" | xargs -L 1 git clone
done
#+END_SRC

#+CAPTION: Update all repos
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for x in *; do git -C $x pull; done
#+END_SRC

* TODO Make a ~.dir-locals.el~ file for this directory
Reference:
- [[info:emacs#Directory%20Variables][info:emacs#Directory Variables]]

** TODO All files
*** TODO Wrap lines
- EOL behavior
  - [[help:toggle-truncate-lines][toggle-truncate-lines]]
  - [[help:toggle-word-wrap][toggle-word-wrap]]
- Wrap at last column
  - [[help:visual-line-mode][visual-line-mode]]
- Wrap at specific column
  - [[help:set-fill-column][set-fill-column]]
  - [[help:visual-fill-column-mode][visual-fill-column-mode]]

*** TODO Remove unnecessary escape characters
- [ ] "\." -> "."
- [ ] "\-" -> "-"
- [ ] "\(" -> "("
- [ ] "\)" -> ")"

At first, I was hoping to accomplish this using text properties just
like with my plan to [[*Hide header anchors][hide header anchors]], but unfortunately, I don't
think that is going to work, because elisp does not have lookahead
assertions.  Essentially, I was hoping to match and hide *only* the
backslash, but I cannot do that.

An alternative would be to use [[info:elisp#Overlay%20Properties][overlay properties]] such as ~hidden~ and
~before-string~... But I don't really know how I'm going to do that.

** TODO Markdown
*** TODO Hide markup
- [[help:markdown-toggle-markup-hiding][markdown-toggle-markup-hiding]]

*** TODO Clean up list numbers
- [[help:markdown-cleanup-list-numbers][markdown-cleanup-list-numbers]]

*** TODO Hide header anchors
For example:

#+CAPTION: Before
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Amazon ECR Registries<a name="Registries"></a>
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+CAPTION: After
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Amazon ECR Registries
#+END_EXAMPLE

This should be fairly easy to accomplish using the ~invisible~ text
property applied to regexp matches of HTML tags in Markdown buffers
using [[help:font-lock-mode][font-lock-mode]].

*** TODO Wrap text in list items appropriately
Take a look at the ~wrap-prefix~ [[info:elisp#Overlay%20Properties][overlay property]].  That would be an
excellent way to accomplish this.

** TODO Restructured Text

* TODO Make symlinks to each index file
* TODO Correlate these docs with the CLI man pages
